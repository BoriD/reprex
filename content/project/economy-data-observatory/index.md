Our [Economy Data Observatory](https://economy.dataobservatory.eu/) is an incubator of fully automated, open source, open data observatories that produces new indicators from open data sources and experimental big data sources, with authoritative copies and a modern API about economic phenomena.

We would like to create early-warning, risk, economic effect, and impact indicators that can be used in scientific, business and policy contexts for professionals who are working on re-setting the European economy after a devastating pandemic and in the age of AI. We would like to map data between economic activities (NACE), antitrust markets, and sub-national, regional, metropolitian area data.
