We launched our [Demo Music Observatory](https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-09-15-music-observatory-launch/) in September 2020 and got into the presitgious [Yes!Delft AI Validation Lab](https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-09-25-yesdelft-validation/). Our demo observatory is an example how we believe the European Data Observatory should be built. An observatory is a permanent observation point for social and economic data. We want to prove that this process can be made cost-effectively and efficiently, providing a high-quality, valuable and timely product by employing best practices in research automation and open source software, using open data in open collaboration with the music industry, artists, technicians and managers.

We want to support the European music industry and our friends in North America, Australia, and all over the world to turn the tables with \@ref(innovation) [innovation](#innovation) coming from the open source community.

* We want to help you to create alternative recommendation engines that actually recommend songs from your country, and we want to give you very clear export market targets with the help of [AI](#ai).

* We want your evidence to stand a fighting chance against large teams of professional legal and economics teams on the other side with [proper valuations and damage claims](#valuation).  And we want to present all those hundreds and thousands of pages automatically, going through dozens and dozens of automated "unit-tests" until nobody can find errors.

* We want you to be able to prove to your fans, the press, your economy minister that music in many countries has not been at the mercy of the taxpayer, but has been carrying far heavier tax burdens than manufacturers.  We want to make your case that the music industry plays a vital role in the European economic recovery and job creation, because we can create [economic impact assessments](#eia) on GDP, employment, tax, import and export effects automatically. 

* Because music and culture are often managed at the level of cities, regions and communities, we want to give you all the data on sub-national levels, whether for regions, metropolitan areas or smaller divisions. 

This is why we are launching now or [Demo Music Observatory](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/) and soon its twin, the Creative and [Cultural Sectors Demo Observatory](https://ccs.dataobservatory.eu/). We believe that the tides are turning because both regulators and these industries have started to fight back, and there is an awful lot of value, money and creativity is at stake.

- [x] The European Music Observatory should fully exploit the EU's **open data** regime. (See our examples: [our first open data release](https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-04-16-regional-opendata-release/)))
- [x] It should be transparent, the indicator design should be based on open-source statistical software.
- [x] The European Music Observatory must embrace evidence-based [open Policy Analysis](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/approach.html#opa)
- [x] The observatory must allow a seamless [data integration](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/approach.html#dataintegration) between open data, and highly confidential proprietary data.
- [x] The open collaboration principle must allow an easy opt-in and opt-out for small and larger, public and private organizations, and offer for full transparency for all users.
- [ ] It should not re-collect data that already exists.
