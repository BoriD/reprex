We launched our [Demo Music Observatory](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/) on 15 September 2020 and got into the prestigious Yes!Delft AI Validation Lab. Our demo observatory is a subjective example on how we believe the European Data Observatory should be built, and follows the structure laid out in the Feasibility study for the establishment of a European Music Observatory.

The Demo Music Observatory has four pillars --- click through to get our demo indicators, descriptions, and methodological notes.

1. [Music Economy](https://data.music.dataobservatory.eu/music-economy.html) 
2. [Diversity & Circulation](https://data.music.dataobservatory.eu/music-diversity.html)
3. [Music & Society](https://data.music.dataobservatory.eu/music-society.html)
4. [Innovation - innovative data applications](https://data.music.dataobservatory.eu/innovation.html)

An observatory is a permanent observation point for social and economic data. We want to prove that this process can be made cost-effectively and efficiently, providing a high-quality, valuable and timely product by employing best practices in research automation and open source software, using open data in open collaboration with the music industry, artists, technicians and managers.

We are working on a broader, creative industry observatory and another one related to the challenges of new sustainability regulations.

Our data observatories are loose collaborations without a permanent budget.  They serve as a basis to share investment and maintenance costs for permanent data collections, and to allow access to new research and granting opportunities. They are open for trade associations, collective management societies, university research groups, music industry companies, consultancies, and even for individual researchers, too. 

## What do we expect from our observatory partners?

`Participate in data curation`: help observatory partners to understand data needs and potential data sources. We add value by automated processing and controls, but we need domain specific academic, business, policy expertise to assess the value of the data.

`Shared exploitation`: Use the observatory data tables, data assets, and publicly reference them.  Some of the observatory assets are open for the public, others by the nature of the scientific or regulatory use, will become public after peer-review or external audit.  We prioritize the embargo, business, or other interests of our observatory partners.

`Funding`: a commitment to participation in funding.  We are flexible to adjust to project-based and permanent funding, and various budgetary options available for academic institutions, trade associations and collective management societies, business, and policy consultancies. We give priority for non-project-based funding because continuous data collection allows significant costs savings but requires continuous base funding.

`Validation`: In use, critically test, assess the joint data assets, and suggests improvements. Our data assets are open to many levels of validations: we give full access to the data and the code that creates the indicators, and we validated both the data and the code. We believe in peer-review and external audit, and we encourage our users to use our data in peer-reviewed or externally audited applications. We are committed to use the feedback from such external reviews promptly for continuous quality improvement.

`Seek recognition and funding`: Our aim is to participate any of the available EU, UNESCO or OECD recognition and funding schemes for our observatories.  This enables a higher level of validation, recognition, and excess to base funding for a permanent data program.

Currently, we are tracking 71 existing and already closed observatories, and seek possibilities of joining, collaborating with existing ones, or to take over historical data assets from defunct observatories.

Reprex has participated in the [Yes!Delft AI+Blockchain Validation Lab](/post/2020-09-25-yesdelft-validation/) to find a suitable business model for our automated, high value-for-money data observatories. In 2021 we will try to put validated ideas into practice, with a flexible adaptation.
