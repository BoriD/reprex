Daniel Antal will introduce `Listen Local Lithuania`, a new offspring of the [Digital Music Observatory](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/)’s trustworthy AI program, [Listen Local](http://listen-local.net/), and show what artists, managers, labels, and cultural policymakers can do to ideas about balancing the post-Covid revenues with increased sales on global platforms.

Based on our experience in Slovakia (see: [Feasibility Study On Promoting Slovak Music In Slovakia & Abroad]), and new data from Lithuania and Ukraine we show what data management problems make the Lithuanian music invisible for the AI algorithms of YouTube, Spotify and other platforms; how artists from Vilnius or Kaunas can find their new release on [Forgetify](https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-10-24-forgetify_pop_october/), and app that plays songs that were never played. We show why music revenues decreased in the past years for independent and small country catalogues, and we give practical advice on increasing the value and visibility of the Lithuanian music repertoire. We show an open, data federation model to connect the Lithuanian national library the system of collective management, distributors, and small data of artists and labels.

## Prepare your questions

You can [send questions](https://reprex.nl/#contact) prior to the conference to the speaker, [Daniel Antal](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/author/daniel-antal/), and we'll address your problem with examples in the talk. 

## Opt-in

It is managed by MXF in collaboration with Music Export Ukraine and Reprex.

[MXF](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/author/mxf-muzikos-eksporto-fondas/) and the outcomes of the `Listen Local Lithuania` will participate in the OpenMusE project, an international research and innovation project with prestigious universities, music industry stakeholders, collective management organizations, and innovative SMEs to design tools that promote the diversity of music on global platforms, increase the revenues and decrease the data costs of music organizations, provide cultural policymakers with the Open Policy Analysis framework the first time in Europe. This open collaboration project funded for 2023-2025 is open for small and large music organizations, collective management organizations, libraries, and cultural policymakers.
