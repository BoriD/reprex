Open Data Day is an annual celebration of open data all over the world. It is an opportunity to show the benefits of open data and encourage the adoption of open data policies in government, business, and civil society. Reprex is a start-up that utilizes open data with open-source reproducible research: please challenge us with your data requests and participate in our web events.

## Webinar 1: Mapping air quality and perceptions of air quality

_In this use case we will show you how you can access historic survey data about perceptions of air quality and attitudes towards environmental policies with the actual air quality measured where the survey respondents live.  We will put survey answers and air pollution measurements on detailed maps to see the interplay._
