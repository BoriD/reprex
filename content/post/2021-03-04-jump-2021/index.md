Reprex's project, the automated [Demo Music Observatory](https://reprex.nl/project/music-observatory/) will be represented by Daniel Antal, co-founder of Reprex among other building bridges projects. This project offers a different approach to the planned European Music Observatory based on the principles of open collaboration, which allows contributions from small organizations and even individuals, and which provides higher levels of quality in terms of auditability, timeliness, transparency and general ease of use. Our open collaboration approach allows to power trustworthy, ethical AI systems like our [Listen Local](https://reprex.nl/project/listen-local/) that we started out from Slovakia with the support of the Slovak Arts Council. 



Reprex is a start-up company based in the Netherlands and the United States that validated its early products in the [Yes!Delft AI+Blockchain Lab](post/2020-09-25-yesdelft-validation/) in the Hague. In 2021 we joined the Dutch AI Coalition -- [NL AIC](post/2021-02-16-nlaic/) and requested membership in the European AI Alliance. Reprex is committed to applying reproducible in an open collaboration with our business, scientific, policy and civil society partners, and facilitate the use of open data and open-source software.
