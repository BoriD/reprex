We bring the benefits of big data to small organizations: SMEs, NGOs, university research labs, management and policy consultants. We help our clients to get access to large enough datasets, and to build trustworthy scientific, policy, business, or AI applications with the data.  Reprex grew out of CEEMID, a project that connected data and pooled surveys across 12 countries and more than 50 music industry stakeholders, creating thousands of relevant policies, statistical and scientific indicators for the music and creative industries.

Our flagship demo projects are the [Listen Local](/project/listen-local/) ethical music recommendation system based on our [Demo Music Observatory](/project/music-observatory/) data integration and knowledge sharing platform.
