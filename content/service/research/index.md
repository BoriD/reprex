title: Reproducible Research
summary: We create document-, presentation-, website-, and newsletter templates that are auto-refreshing their data contents, visualizations, citations, and other technical documentation items, taking care of error-prone and time-consuming revisions of technical documents, such as consulting reports, scientific publications, litigation documents and regulatory filings.

## Advantages of reproducible research

* Improves work habits, enhances the efficiency of analysts.

* Increases teamwork, makes the integration, substitution and replacement of team members far easier.

* Avoids duplication and multiplication of efforts. Dramatically reduces the time spend on data manipulation and debugging, error searching, formatting. This can save up to 80% of working time in analyst and consultant roles.

* Relief senior staff as oversight is far more efficient, as most errors are captured automatically.

* Better suited for cumulative growth of data, information and knowledge. In the medium run it reduces data and information cost significantly, and over the long run it produces a very strong competitive edge.

* Replication, reproducibility and the higher standards of confirmabiliy and auditability are not only scientific standards, but they are often set by market regulators, professional standards and internal working guidelines --- these are far easier to achieve with automation.

* Access to the growing body of open data in the EU (such as survey data, raw data used to calculate the inflation, etc.), which is as raw data free or almost free, but has large processing costs, as it is offered by public bodies on an as-is basis. This can replace costlier and less valuable data acquisitions.

## Our Software Solutions

Our reproducible research solutions go through rigorous unit-testing and anonymous peer-review before release. They are fully open source, their use causes no unforseen costs or vendor lock-in.  You are even free to modify the software, provided that you do not sell our product as commercial software.

[iotables](/software/iotables/) is a reproducible research tool that is able to work with national accounts and create some satellite accounts for all EU member states. It was originally developed to calculate the economic impacts of the Hungarian tax shelter before renewal (state aid notification at DG Competition) and for the Slovak Music Industry Report, which used similar methodology to prove that CCS sectors are overtaxed in the country. The iotables open source statistical software library is used by about 800 practicioners in the world.

[regions](/software/regions/) solves the problem that Europe’s regional boundaries have changes in several thousand places over the last 20 years, and therefore member states and Eurostat’s regional statistics are not comparable for more than 2-3 years. This software validates, and where possible, changes the regional coding from NUTS1999 till the not yet used NUTS2021, opening up . It was originally designed in a research project at IVIR in the University of Amsterdam to understand the geographical dynamics of book piracy. Because of the needs this software fills, it had 700 users in the first month after publication.

[retorhamonize](/software/iotables/) is a software that allows the programmatic retrospective harmonization of surveys, such as the last 35 years of all Eurobarometer microdata, or all Afrobarometer microdata. Eurobarometer grew out of the need of certain CEE member states’ need to get comparable data about their music and audiovisual sectors. We commissioned surveys following ESSNet-Culture guidelines, and joined their data with open access European microdata-level surveys.
