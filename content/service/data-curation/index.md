If you do not find the right data for your policy evaluation, your consulting project, your PhD thesis, your market research, or scientific research project, it does not mean that the data does not exist.  It does not mean that the data is not available for free. 

- [x] Every day, thousands and thousands of new datasets are becoming available and re-usable from public and scientific sources.
