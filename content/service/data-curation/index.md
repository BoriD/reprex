**If you do not find the right data for your policy evaluation, your consulting project, your PhD thesis, your market research, or scientific research project, it does not mean that the data does not exist.  It does not mean that the data is not available for free. In our experience, up to 95% of available open data is never used.**

Everyday, thousands of new datasets are becoming available via the EU open data regime, US and other jurisdictions freedom of information legislation, or open science and scientific reproducibility requirements --- but as they are packaged or processed for a different primary, original use, usually only experts of open data find this data and can be bring it to a usable form for re-use in business, scientific or policy research. 

The creative and cultural industries are often not participating in government statistical programs, because they almost exclusively consist of microenterprises that are exempted from statistical reporting and file only simplified financial statements and tax returns.  This means that finding the appropriate private or public data sources requires particularly good data maps.

`Data curation` means that we are continuously mapping potential data sources, and we are sending requests to download and put though quality tests newer and newer data sources.  Our CEEMID project has produced several thousand indicators, out of which a few dozen is available in our [Demo Music Observatory](/project/music-observatory/).  If you have special data needs for a scientific research, policy evaluation or business project, we can find you the most suitable, best value for money data for analysis or [ethical AI applications](/localhost:4321/service/trustworthy-ai/).
