An observatory is a permanent location to observe terrestrial or celestial objects.  A data observatory is a permanent data collection program that observes primary facts about the economy, society, or a research domain.  Observatories used to be brick-and-mortar institutions where researchers could test their hypothesis.  A data observatory is a shared data infrastructure that can serve market, business, policy, or scientific research interests.

## Who needs a data observatory?
In the age of big data and AI data appears to be ubiquitous.  It does not mean that the same data can be found anywhere, anytime. Observing social attitudes or customer choices via surveys, recording data from big data APIs or simply saving data from internet sources is only possible in a short time window.  We cannot reliably ask people what they were thinking in 2011 or what they were doing in 2013; APIs usually give access to data for about 90 days.

## Reproducible research: automate, shared data collection

The problem with ongoing data collection programs is that they are usually available only to big corporations, governments, and the largest research universities.  Industries with small enterprises only, like the creative music, book or film industry, smaller research institutes, business and policy consultancies do not have the human resources, infrastructure, and budget to maintain ongoing data collection.  This means that they rely on big business and government with ad hoc data requests when they need to test a hypothesis, develop a new strategy, or design a policy based on evidence.

We believe that data observatories can be great collaborations on sharing budget, resources, and exploitation of data. However, data observatories often lack a sizable, permanent body that can scale up data collection.  We believe that these problems can be resolved with research automation and open collaboration.

## Our Observatories

## Existing observatories

We have reviewed 71 observatories -- mainly collaborations that are supported by various EU, OECD or UNESCO bodies, but we have found fully private initiatives, too.
