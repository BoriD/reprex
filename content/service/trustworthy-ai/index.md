`Bid data creates injustice`. Small enterprises are losing markets, their profit margins are squeezed by large, algorithmic, robotic sales platforms.  Unchecked algorithms of government bodies and big businesses create injustice, disinformation, and inequality.  Scientific research is being concentrated to places with the best data availability. 

An equitable access to AI and holding AI algorithms accountable requires data â€“ plenty of data. Until small market players, NGOs, researchers, journalist do not have access to big data, their ability to hold algorithms accountable and to design more ethical algorithms is practically non-existent.  Small enterprises, like record labels, film distributors, book publishers, policy and scientific research institutes can only become competitive with big corporation, big government entities and the largest research labs if they can access open data and they can share many small data. 

The European Union has created the [Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/ethics-guidelines-trustworthy-ai), which aim to ensure that non-discrimination, fairness, diversity, and societal well-being will be supported by AI systems in a transparent and auditable way.  These broad ethical guidelines have been regulated for example by the protection of fundamental rights, consumer protection, consumer protection, or, in the cultural sector by media and broadcasting regulation.  The Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI are only recommendations, they cannot be enforced, unless small businesses in the marketplace, NGOs, competition authorities, and other relevant parties are able to hold AI application accountable.
