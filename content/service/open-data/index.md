**Everyday, thousands of new datasets are becoming available via the EU open data regime, US and other jurisdictions freedom of information legislation, or open science and scientific reproducibility requirements.**

These datasets are usually very reliable, high value datasets, and their cumulated estimated value is close to 100 billion euros in the EU alone.  But they offer no free lunch: originally collected to evaluate policies, measure the inflation, control tax returns, predict the weather or traffic jams, they usually require a thorough reprocessing for their re-use in the music industry or another new context. Our software solutions automate this process – for example, whenever price data is collected to measure the inflation in EU countries, we take out the price data of cultural products automatically.

The creative and cultural industries are often not participating in government statistical programs, because they almost exclusively consist of microenterprises that are exempted from statistical reporting and file only simplified financial statements and tax returns.  In the creative & cultural sector, industry-organized data collection is particularly important.  We are mapping all important global and European data collection, and we often carry out primary data collection for European stakeholders. Access and sharing these data on a continuous, programmatic basis is similarly possible (after the necessary approvals of data owners), just like in the case of open data, open science, or freedom-of-information sources. 


## European open data

The European data regulation uses the expression `open data` for anonymized or non-confidential data that has been collected by a public sector organization. Such data is usually open for re-use.

While re-usable public sector information (often covered in other jurisdictions by freedom of information (FOI) legislation is free or requires only a marginal cost reimbursement, is usually not directly usable.  The data was collected and processed for the needs of a primary use, such as tax administration, or short-term meteorological forecasting, or understanding current public opinion about a policy proposal.  To make use of the information content, the data usually must be reprocessed, normalized, units and currency must be translated, and various other processing steps must be carried out without error.

## Open Science

First class scientific journals require the publication of the empirical data or other data that supported the published scientific claim. This means that a large part of the empirical data input into the world’s high-level scientist output is freely available.  Similarly to re-usable public sector data, this data is high-quality and cheap, but it is processed to the needs of the original scientific inquiry. The data usually needs to be reprocessed exactly the same way as re-used public sector information.

## Survey harmonization {#retroharmonize}

In economics and social sciences, market research, politics and policy design, surveys are the primary sources of information.  Online, telephone and personal interviews are transcribed into various datasets that are, in the case of public sector or scientific origin, are often available for free re-use. 

The cost of surveying has exploded, and because of the increasing number of short, online surveys, survey fatigue is plaguing the population.  The cost of high-quality surveys representative for the general (consumer, voter) population of the European Union is around a million euros; even national or regional surveys are alone often out of the reach of smaller research organizations.  
Our solution to this is a software supported retrospective survey harmonization.  We are looking up survey questionnaires where your question has been asked before, and create accompanying surveys that show either the change, or a more specific detail. This allows timewise, international, inter-regional comparison, and can reduce surveying costs significantly.

We also try to syndicate surveys. Our music professional surveys, for example, has been asking harmonized questions in a growing number of countries music professional population, allowing a comparison of music economics since 2014.
