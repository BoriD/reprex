# CEEMID

- In 2014 Artisjus, HDS and SOZA realized that need to make further efforts to modernize the way they measure their own economic impact, the economic value of their licenses to remain competitive in advocating the interests vis-Ã -vis domestic governments, international organizations like CISAC and GESAC and the European Union
- Origins in [CISAC Good Governance Seminar for European Societies](https://ceemid.eu/post/2013-11-18_cisac_goodgov/) and an abandoned GESAC project.
